                There they sat—one young woman and two young men, their clothes drab and their hair unkempt—huddled together as if for warmth. All around them, people were talking, joking, laughing. Not these three. They clutched half-eaten burritos like starving children, whispering among themselves. 
                <br> <br>
                I walked over. I said something. 
                <br> <br>
                They stopped and stared at me. Their faces were wary and bewildered, as if they were zoo animals and I had rattled the bars of their cage. 
                <br> <br>
                "Thanks," said one of the young men. I never knew someone could mumble and snarl in one syllable. There was no gratitude in the word—only a sardonic loathing that seemed aimed at everything and everyone in the room, maybe even the young man who said it. Then he turned back to his two comrades and resumed whispering. I stood there for a few seconds before I realized I had been dismissed. 
                <br> <br>
                All I'd said was, "I really love your band."

                Annexed to the less mainstream channels of indie releases, low-budget touring, and a circuit of basement and underground shows, Unwound still managed to create some of the more influential and lasting work of their era.

              <blockquote>
                With a band like Unwound, its influence and successors far outshine its own story. Which is a shame, because Unwound synthesized all that was exciting about Olympia and music in the Pacific Northwest. Its music dark and often experimental; it had pop riffs that grew out of murkiness only to disappear again; its songs gave you glimmers of light but never flooded you with sun; there was angst but not brutality; it possessed an uneven wilderness, which is all you'd ever want from music, something unexpected emerging from what we already know.

                The trio then decided to do, in concept, a very punk rock thing: they each took on an instrument they did not know how to play. Sandeno played drums, Trosper the guitar, and Rumsey the bass.

                Kill Rock Stars, an Independent label based out of Olympia, undersaw a shift from producing exclusively spoken word in 1993 after its owner, Slim Moon, went to see a new local band live - Unwound. <i>Fake Train</i> would be Kill Rock Stars' first music album. 
              </p>
              <p>
                Drowned in distortion and waves of feedback, <i>Fake Train</i> soon marked itself as a greatly influential album in the American underground. 
                On <i>Fake Train</i>'s unrelenting 2nd track "Lucky Acid," Unwound heightens the frantic intensity of their unreleased self-titled LP.

                I clench my fist when I think of the list of popular albums people associate with the '90's, how utterly worthless most of those albums are, how horrible they sound, and that this gem of an album didn't get its chance to influence the kids who were influenced by all the wrong things instead.

                Unwound were (and still are) beautiful people. Unwound was one of the most influential and vital bands of the '90s, and their last record was a masterpiece. You just don't know it yet. Unwound's influence will live on for a long time to come, and they were everything a band should be: independent and non-compromising in every aspect.
