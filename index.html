              <p>
                Tumwater's Unwound emerged in 1991 an unknown quantity on the face of rock, remaining shrouded in obscurity until their 2002 breakup. 
                Despite this, the legacy of their work has instilled a lasting impact in the American underground, demonstrating the depth a band can achieve with little more than genuine passion.
              </p>
              <p> 
                Though originally set firmly in a growing post-hardcore scene, Unwound developed into a band unbound by labels along a journey of exploration and experimentation. 
              </p>
              <p>
                By examining their discography, an understanding can be gained on the nature of growth - from pain to clarity.

                There they sat—one young woman and two young men, their clothes drab and their hair unkempt—huddled together as if for warmth. All around them, people were talking, joking, laughing. Not these three. They clutched half-eaten burritos like starving children, whispering among themselves. 
                <br> <br>
                I walked over. I said something. 
                <br> <br>
                They stopped and stared at me. Their faces were wary and bewildered, as if they were zoo animals and I had rattled the bars of their cage. 
                <br> <br>
                "Thanks," said one of the young men. I never knew someone could mumble and snarl in one syllable. There was no gratitude in the word—only a sardonic loathing that seemed aimed at everything and everyone in the room, maybe even the young man who said it. Then he turned back to his two comrades and resumed whispering. I stood there for a few seconds before I realized I had been dismissed. 
                <br> <br>
                All I'd said was, "I really love your band."

                With a band like Unwound, its influence and successors far outshine its own story. Which is a shame, because Unwound synthesized all that was exciting about Olympia and music in the Pacific Northwest. 
                <br> <br>
                Its music dark and often experimental; it had pop riffs that grew out of murkiness only to disappear again; its songs gave you glimmers of light but never flooded you with sun; there was angst but not brutality; it possessed an uneven wilderness, which is all you'd ever want from music, something unexpected emerging from what we already know.

                Just know that if you like contemporary music even remotely associated with artsy, experimental, sorta fucked up rock music, you like a band that sounds at least a little bit like Unwound. You enjoy a band greatly influenced by them, or at the very least has cribbed a few of their tricks.

                Unwound's first, self-titled album reveals the band at their most raw. 
                The only album featuring the band's first drummer, Brandt Sandeno, <i>Unwound</i> takes the formula of their hardcore predecessors to darker sonic territories. 
              </p>
              <p>
                Unwound combines '80s hardcore resounding guitar lines on tracks such as "Kid Gone," "You Bite My Tongue," and "Warmth" with "Stuck in The Middle of Nowhere Again," introducing the slower, darker, more melodic progressions the band would later explore, develop, and perfect. 
              </p>
              <p>
                From Justin Trosper's frenzied yelling, metallic guitar scratching, grating noise, driving 8th note guitar lines, the band consistently plants the listening in an anxious soundscape. 
                This chaos culminates in <i>Unwound's</i> closer, "Kandy Korn Rituals", seeing the band at their most explosive and dissonant with Trosper's screams reaching a disturbing desperation.

                The trio then decided to do, in concept, a very punk rock thing: they each took on an instrument they did not know how to play. Sandeno played drums, Trosper the guitar, and Rumsey the bass.

                Olympia-based independent label Kill Rock Stars, undersaw a shift from producing exclusively spoken word in 1993 after its owner, Slim Moon, went to see a new local band live - Unwound. <i>Fake Train</i> would be Kill Rock Stars' first music album. 
                Drowned in distortion and waves of feedback, <i>Fake Train</i> soon marked itself as a greatly influential album in the American underground. 
              </p>
              <p>
                Continuing the intensity of their unreleased self-titled LP, <i>Fake Train</i> shows an Unwound beginning to sprout, introducing the angular rythmns and melodic expanses that would come to serve as the bedrock of the band's later work.
              </p>
              <p> 
                <i>Fake Train</i> matches its frantic, unrelenting "Lucky Acid" with songs that, while still heavy, feature extended instrumental interludes where Unwound's guitars let free to chart a course across an unknown landscape of distortion and texture, bound by an eerie melody.
                Among these introspective expanses arrives "Were, Are, and Was or Is," a mouthful of a song that transports the listener from our cold reality to a five minute and forty four second melodic, guitar-driven, purely-instrumental world.

                By the time of Fake Train's release in 1993 there was a well established, nation-wide scene of post-hardcore bands, including Fugazi, Husker Dü, Slint, and The Jesus Lizard, who were striving to expand the sonic boundaries of hardcore whilst maintaining it's mangled aesthetic. 
                <br> <br>
                This new approach allowed for a greater complexity of melody and rhythm, the creation of slow-burning compositions, and the use of spatialised effects such as echo and reverb.

                In a few months, deep into a grueling tour schedule, Unwound delivered their sophmore 1994 release, New Plastic Ideas. 
                Despite the uphill battle Unwound was faced with, the band further expanded their unique mix of angular rythmns and dream-like interludes from a mere addition to a defining sonic trait.
              </p>
              <p> 
                With Sara Lund's drumming developing a distinct, fill-driven style, the Tumwater trio pressed headfirst into noise rock with irregularity at heart, evidenced immediately by their explosive album opener, "Entirely Different Matters."
              </p>
              <p> 
                The middle stretch of <i>New Plastic Ideas</i> introduces "Abstraktions," a true 7 minute long instrumental successor to <i>Fake Train's</i> "Were, Are, and Was or Is", descending into a desolate abyss rather than blissful entropy. 
                Providing a helping hand out of the previous track's dark, vast soundscape "All Souls Day" pulls the listener straight back into Unwound's juxtaposing uncompromising noise.
              </p>
              <p> In an album littered with bleak tones and jaded lyrics, <i>New Plastic Ideas'</i> closing "Fiction Friction" delivers a killing blow.</p>

                Most of all, Blonde Redhead were astonished by "the impact of the music," Makino said. "I think we had huge question marks coming out of our heads as we watched. It almost sounded like classical music to me, what they were playing, because I couldn't tell how each person, how what they were playing related to one another."

                So many bands have taken that one guitar figure on "Fiction Friction" to the bank numerous times along with the sad ennui of the song's first section, which spills into messy, soul-draining catharsis and the woozy sputtering out that comes after.

                Although Justin and Vern had written songs in drop D with Brandt and for Fake Train, they consider "Arboretum," one of the signature tracks on New Plastic Ideas, their first real foray into non-standard tunings. 
                <br> <br>
                "We tuned up just a half-step, to F, so the barre chords would be bigger," Justin explained. "But the cool thing about alternate tunings is they're all based on open tunings, so certain strings ring out. 
                And in that song, the part where it's droning on that one note, we could do different combinations of harmonics."

                From the outset, <i>The Future of What</i> swiftly identifies itself as Unwound's heaviest work to date - a challenge to rock that never holds back. 
              </p>
              <p>
                The album's opener, "New Energy" explodes with waves of dissonance cornered by angular riffs and drums. 
                <!-- The following track, "Demolished" not only underscores Unwound's refined guitar interplay between Trosper and Rumsey, but exposes the band's Sonic Youth influences across the song's bridge. -->
                Songs such as "Equally Stupid" come to be defined by odd time signatures that leave the listener off-balance, grasping for a semblance of familiarity to hold onto for dear life.
                Others, like "Pedals Like Bricks" arrives with a wall of noise that hits that same listener with like a brick.
              </p>
              <p> 
                "Here Comes The Dogs" adopting the opening riff on Nirvana's "Smells Like Team Spirit" before dropping a bassline with an attitude throws away any and all expectations - a defiant rejection of the oversaturation of grunge.
              </p>
              <p>
                <i>The Future of What</i> isn't just lyrically depressing. Justin Trosper on "Disappoint" steps beyond the bound of language to deliver a guitar drenched in emotion, closing on the song on a riff that pleads, isolated and abandoned.

                If it had been up to me, I think that record would have been even harsher, but I think Vern and Sara reigned it in, doing what they do. We wound up hooking people not necessarily with a riff but with the rhythm.

                The most surprising moment on <i>The Future of What</i>, and arguably in the entire Unwound catalog to that point, is "Pardon My French," a creepy, archaic waltz Justin and Sara created in the studio while goofing around with an optigan, a shoddily designed organ from the 1970s that paired a miniature keyboard with a built-in playback system for optical discs encoded with various prerecorded instrumental tracks.

                The reason that song is called "Swan"—well, I might be making this up—but I went and saw the Swans play, and not that our song was derived from them, but after it was written, I thought, that has that feeling of when I went and saw the Swans, just that pounding fucking sound. 
                <br> <br>
                And during the recording, I kept going back and adding guitar tracks. Everybody was like, really, another one? And I'd be like, no, really, it's gotta be there. To get the right effect, it has to be overdone.

                The date had been celebrated, during a show with Brainiac at the Grog Shop in Cleveland, with copious amounts of bourbon and an onstage performance by Captain America, a “beefy stripper in stars and stripes spandex shorts and a white denim vest,” as Sara described him. 
                <br> <br>
                He'd been hired by Dirty, Justin, and Vern to do "some grinding thing" on Sara in the middle of Unwound's set, in front of the entire crowd.

                It doesn't take long to realize that 1996's Repetition is defined by Vern Rumsey who makes it immediately clear that he owns this album. 
                With their bassist at the forefront, Unwound takes its brand of moody post-hardcore to a tighter and groovier place than ever witnessed prior. 
              </p>
              <p>
                <!-- Holding true to its name,  -->
                Opening tracks "Message Received," "Corpse Pose," and "Unauthorized Autobiography" make it no illusion how refined Trosper and Rumsey's guitar interplay has become since the band's inception.
              </p>
              <p>
                The record also serves as the petri dish for Unwound's noise experimentation, with shrill, shrieking guitars interpliced between the mysterious verses on "Lowest Common Denominator" and driving rythmn of "Fingernails on a Chalkboard".
                The latter song, making expert use of a clave-esque drum beat, sends the listener down an anxious spiral, catalyzed by a seemingly unresolved 5/4 time signature.
              </p>
              <p>
                "Go to Dallas and Take a Left" ends in free jazz pandemonium, foreshadowing the ambition running through Unwound's to-be 1998 LP Challenge For a Civilized Society.
              </p>
              <p>
                "Lady Elect" stands as a solumn tribute to a friend of Justin Trosper who committed suicide before the recording of the album, carrying all the emotional weight of a man crippled by loss.

                While thematically it's a bit of a throwback, a media and culture rant of the sort that fueled <i>The Future of What</i>, "For Your Entertainment" lacks Future's sense of distance. Considering all that had transpired with Unwound professionally over the previous year, a line like "they'll pick your life apart and throw away your art" could easily be read as Justin admonishing himself. 
                <br> <br>
                He screams the word "entertainment" as a hook, attacking it syllable by syllable, but despite the force of his voice, he doesn't sound disgusted or angry. He sounds amused.

                By <i>Repetition</i>, I'd failed in some relationships and then, right before we recorded the album, my friend committed suicide, so my emotional landscape dropped pretty heavily.

                That the song is concerned with death is easy to discern from the lyrics, but it's the production and Justin's performance that lend the song its emotional weight. 
                <br> <br>
                The register he sings in is lower than his customary range, giving his voice a tentative, vulnerable quality rather than the aggressively disaffected tone he typically adopted. 
                The vocals on the chorus are doubled, preserving the sense of rawness while also adding heft. 
                <br> <br>
                Vibraphone delicately ushers in each chord change of the outro. The melodic wail of feedback that ends the track gently soars up an octave and then slowly evaporates.

                I've always felt frustrated, like mad at the world, for under-appreciating Unwound. I always felt their ceiling should have been a hundred times what they maxed out at. I thought they should have been playing Lollapalooza and festivals, and selling 100,000 records, 250,000 records, and flirting with the radio. And I've always wondered, what the fuck, where did it go wrong? 
                <br> <br>
                Maybe Kill Rock Stars just never got enough clout. Maybe we were never a big-enough label. They should've busted out after <i>Repetition</i>, and that's when their trajectory didn't go where I expected. And to this day I don't know why, because I feel like they did everything right.

                <i>Challenge For a Civilized Society</i> is exactly that - a challenge - a demonstration that Unwound couldn't be bound by a genre or label.
              <p>
                The 1998 LP expels any and all expectations, defined by spacious textures, immersive builds, and infectious riffs, the latter especially present on the head-turning "Laugh Track".
              </p>
              <p>
                All of this comes to a head on the album's 7th track, "Side Effects of Being Tired" - a song can only be defined by entropy. 
                The track opens with a driving bassline and dissonant guitar, accompanied by resounding horns, exploding into a free-jazz cacophony with a dying saxophone at the helm.
                Suddenly, the listener is thrust into waves of dissonance, guided down a dizzying psychedelic spiral that dissolves to a tearing sea of white noise, rising out the other side reversed before fading to silence.
              </p>
              <p>
                A horrifingly fitting closer, a 2 minute untitled track finishes out the album with the existential dread of being lost in space.

                You can't sell what we were offering to a mass crowd. We didn't play music you could dance to; we played music that would affect everyone differently, every song, as opposed to keeping one feeling going all the way through one show. 
                <br> <br>
                I hate the term "emo" but I think the crowd that we played to felt connected, and felt everything that we played in the way that we felt it, in their own terms.

                With guitar amps cutting out half the time, guitars well out of tune, broken cymbals, dropped sticks, and completely unintelligible vocals—not to mention the pure pain poured directly into innocent eardrums by way of finely crafted feedback—we had a tendency to cast the audience as enemy.

                If Unwound's discography was the five stages of grief, then <i>Leaves Turn Inside You</i> would be acceptance.
              </p>
              <p>
                Emerging from a homemade studio made out of a barn, the 2001 LP sees Unwound take steps into the winter cold, equally bitter and beautiful.
                Clocking in at a hefty 74 minutes, the Tumwater trio embarks on a journey unlike anything released before or since. 
              </p>
              <p>
                With the chilling guitar riffs of "October All Over", the cathartic bridge on "December", and the mind-bending, dreamy, atmospheric textures throughout "One Lick Less", Unwound abandons their post-hardcore roots, setting themselves to explore <u>their</u> sound - no strings attached. 
              </p>
              <p>
                Suddenly, the band delivers "Terminus" - a track of three worlds - ensuring a false sense of security before the band makes their best chello-backed impression of Godspeed You! Black Emperor, then switching to one of the most beautiful instrumental codas ever laid to tape.
              </p>
              <p>
                At track 13, Unwound reveals "Below the Salt," a dreary ten minute behemoth that observes Unwound - with a piano in their arsenal - build to one final climax, tying a fittingly solemn bow to Unwound's decade-long career.

                "Vern and I had this conversation when we were getting involved with BMG about having a plan in case things got weird," Justin recalled. “It was a drunken conspiracy that I don't think Sara was privy to. We called it our five-year plan or something, and we decided that we would just break up the band in five years no matter what."
                <br> <br>
                Albeit unintentionally, that's exactly what Unwound did. But not before recording their masterpiece.

                There's something especially satisfying about late-blooming bands who spend their whole career building up to their best music, and then calling it a day. 
                <br> <br>
                That's basically Unwound's arc in a nutshell; the Olympia trio spent a decade gradually tweaking and refining their post-hardcore until they achieved genuine transcendence on their monumental swan song, 2001's <i>Leaves Turn Inside You</i>. 
                <br> <br>

                I remember being on a drive on the Washington coast with Justin and him playing some of the basic tracking and overdubs that had been laid down, specifically "Below the Salt" and being totally floored by that. 
                <br> <br>
                Unwound had clearly turned a corner creatively and were writing from a broader palette. The songs were more refined and Justin was bringing more of a melodic approach to singing and writing.

                <br> <br>
                I asked him, "What?" Justin just said "This is the way we do things," like, "We are fucking idiots."

                I remember playing a really good show in Atlanta. We did an extra set of punk covers with Mecca Normal and The Thrones. 
                <br> <br>
                It wasn't all ages, but there were a bunch of kids freaked out from the past few weeks trying to get in. Unwound usually played all-ages events, but for some reason It didn't work out for that show. So I opened the side stage door for them, and they rushed in. 
                <br> <br>
                Years later, Bradford Cox from Deerhunter came up to me and told me he was one of those kids I helped get in. He remembered everything from that night... the covers we did, what amps, pedals and guitars I played!

                Sara and I had always had kind of an abrasive relationship, like brother and sister, so it was easy for us to hate/love each other, but once the music started I loved her. 
                <br> <br>
                She is the best drummer I know of. I could look at her and read her mind, I think that she felt the same way.

                Traveling around was really surreal for sure. I guess it was difficult to play music in the face of the weird emotional atmosphere everywhere. Like, should we really be doing this? I now think that, of course, we should have. 
                <br> <br>
                People tend to continue doing the "normal" things they do even if everything around them is fucked up. That's how you survive bad stuff. 
                <br> <br>
                It's not like you are ignoring the bad situation; you are just acknowledging it and not letting it rule all your decisions that day.

                I think that Justin and Sara put it best. I was stressed, drunk, and high, and I had a new little lady [daughter Lola] that I wanted to be with, so I didn't pull my weight on that tour like I had in the past. 
                <br> <br>
                Usually I was right on top of it, but I fell apart before, during, and after that tour. It was a terrible thing that I couldn't keep it together, but I just couldn't. I lost my strength.

                Unfortunately, because I still feel like we could have put out more music and toured more if I could have kept my shit together.

                Basically, what happened is that Vern dealt with the stress of everything by self-medicating with alcohol, and at our show in San Diego he was unable to really play due to intoxication. 
                <br> <br>
                After the show, he broke one of his hands by punching the wall backstage. 
                <br> <br>
                We had two more shows to play and we sent him home after the next show because it was pointless. His hand was basically a lobster claw. It was craziness, and it was over.

                Our anger and frustration came from his self-destruction and our feeling of total impotence in getting him to stop. We were completely unequipped for this level of damage.

                It wasn't the performances of the songs on any night that made me feel that Unwound would or should break up... not 9/11, losing interest in music or how much everyone loved (and loves) each other. The feedback from longtime friends and fans was positive. Guarantees were up. Major labels were interested.
                <br> <br>
                I have no doubt that Unwound would have had the same success that Modest Mouse has if alcoholism hadn't dimmed all that is bright.
