                There they sat—one young woman and two young men, their clothes drab and their hair unkempt—huddled together as if for warmth. All around them, people were talking, joking, laughing. Not these three. They clutched half-eaten burritos like starving children, whispering among themselves. 
                <br> <br>
                I walked over. I said something. 
                <br> <br>
                They stopped and stared at me. Their faces were wary and bewildered, as if they were zoo animals and I had rattled the bars of their cage. 
                <br> <br>
                "Thanks," said one of the young men. I never knew someone could mumble and snarl in one syllable. There was no gratitude in the word—only a sardonic loathing that seemed aimed at everything and everyone in the room, maybe even the young man who said it. Then he turned back to his two comrades and resumed whispering. I stood there for a few seconds before I realized I had been dismissed. 
                <br> <br>
                All I'd said was, "I really love your band."

              <blockquote>
                With a band like Unwound, its influence and successors far outshine its own story. Which is a shame, because Unwound synthesized all that was exciting about Olympia and music in the Pacific Northwest. Its music dark and often experimental; it had pop riffs that grew out of murkiness only to disappear again; its songs gave you glimmers of light but never flooded you with sun; there was angst but not brutality; it possessed an uneven wilderness, which is all you'd ever want from music, something unexpected emerging from what we already know.

                Just know that if you like contemporary music even remotely associated with artsy, experimental, sorta fucked up rock music, you like a band that sounds at least a little bit like Unwound. You enjoy a band greatly influenced by them, or at the very least has cribbed a few of their tricks

                Unwound's first, self-titled album reveals the band at their most raw. 
                The only album featuring the band's first drummer, Brandt Sandeno, <i>Unwound</i> takes the formula of their hardcore predecessors to darker sonic territories. 
              </p>
              <p>
                Unwound combines '80s hardcore resounding guitar lines on tracks such as "Kid Gone," "You Bite My Tongue," and "Warmth" with "Stuck in The Middle of Nowhere Again," introducing the slower, darker, more melodic progressions the band would later explore, develop, and perfect. 
              </p>
              <p>
                From Justin Trosper's frenzied yelling, metallic guitar scratching, grating noise, driving 8th note guitar lines, the band consistently plants the listening in an anxious soundscape. 
                This chaos culminates in <i>Unwound's</i> closer, "Kandy Korn Rituals", seeing the band at their most explosive and dissonant with Trosper's screams reaching a disturbing desperation.

                The trio then decided to do, in concept, a very punk rock thing: they each took on an instrument they did not know how to play. Sandeno played drums, Trosper the guitar, and Rumsey the bass.

                Taking leads from forebears such as Black Flag, Unwound's roots lay in the break-neck hardcore sound, which rose from the ashes of punk's brief first wave with a vengeance via bands such as Minor Threat, Minutemen, and Dead Kennedys, who took the spartan fundamentals of guitar, bass, and drums to a terminal velocity.

                Olympia-based independent label Kill Rock Stars, undersaw a shift from producing exclusively spoken word in 1993 after its owner, Slim Moon, went to see a new local band live - Unwound. <i>Fake Train</i> would be Kill Rock Stars' first music album. 
                Drowned in distortion and waves of feedback, <i>Fake Train</i> soon marked itself as a greatly influential album in the American underground. 
              </p>
              <p>
                Continuing the intensity of their unreleased self-titled LP, <i>Fake Train</i> shows an Unwound beginning to sprout, introducing the angular rythmns and melodic expanses that would come to serve as the bedrock of the band's later work.
              </p>
              <p> 
                <i>Fake Train</i> matches its frantic, unrelenting "Lucky Acid" with songs that, while still heavy, feature extended instrumental interludes where Unwound's guitars let free to chart a course across an unknown landscape of distortion and texture, bound by an eerie melody.
                Among these introspective expanses arrives "Were, Are, and Was or Is," a mouthful of a song that transports the listener from our cold reality to a five minute and forty four second melodic, guitar-driven, purely-instrumental world.

              <blockquote>
                By the time of Fake Train's release in 1993 there was a well established, nation-wide scene of post-hardcore bands, including Fugazi, Husker Dü, Slint, and The Jesus Lizard, who were striving to expand the sonic boundaries of hardcore whilst maintaining it's mangled aesthetic. This new approach allowed for a greater complexity of melody and rhythm, the creation of slow-burning compositions, and the use of spatialised effects such as echo and reverb.

                In a few months, deep into a grueling tour schedule, Unwound delivered their sophmore 1994 release, New Plastic Ideas. 
                Despite the uphill battle Unwound was faced with, the band further expanded their unique mix of angular rythmns and dream-like interludes from a mere addition to a defining sonic trait.
              </p>
              <p> 
                With Sara Lund's drumming developing a distinct, fill-driven style, the Olympia trio pressed headfirst into noise rock with irregularity at heart, evidenced immediately by their explosive album opener, "Entirely Different Matters."
              </p>
              <p> 
                The middle stretch of <i>New Plastic Ideas</i> introduces "Abstraktions," a true 7 minute long instrumental successor to <i>Fake Train's</i> "Were, Are, and Was or Is", descending into a desolate abyss rather than blissful entropy. 
                Providing a helping hand out of the previous track's dark, vast soundscape "All Souls Day" pulls the listener straight back into Unwound's juxtaposing uncompromising noise.
              </p>
              <p> In an album littered with bleak tones and jaded lyrics, <i>New Plastic Ideas'</i> closing "Fiction Friction" delivers a killing blow.</p>

                Most of all, Blonde Redhead were astonished by "the impact of the music," Makino said. "I think we had huge question marks coming out of our heads as we watched. It almost sounded like classical music to me, what they were playing, because I couldn't tell how each person, how what they were playing related to one another."

                From the outset, <i>The Future of What</i> swiftly identifies itself as Unwound's heaviest work to date - a challenge to rock that never holds back. 
              </p>
              <p>
                The album's opener, "New Energy" explodes with waves of dissonance cornered by angular riffs and drums. 
                <!-- The following track, "Demolished" not only underscores Unwound's refined guitar interplay between Trosper and Rumsey, but exposes the band's Sonic Youth influences across the song's bridge. -->
                Songs such as "Equally Stupid" come to be defined by odd time signatures that leave the listener off-balance, grasping for a semblance of familiarity to hold onto for dear life.
                Others, like "Pedals Like Bricks" arrives with a wall of noise that hits that same listener with like a brick.
              </p>
              <p> 
                "Here Comes The Dogs" adopting the opening riff on Nirvana's "Smells Like Team Spirit" before dropping a bassline with an attitude throws away any and all expectations - a defiant rejection of the oversaturation of grunge.
              </p>
              <p>
                <i>The Future of What</i> isn't just lyrically depressing. Justin Trosper on "Disappoint" steps beyond the bound of language to deliver a guitar drenched in emotion, closing on the song on a riff that pleads, isolated and abandoned.

                To me it was sort of this anti-grunge thing, like, these are ideas we should be thinking about. The popular alternative stuff was just the most boring aspects of underground music. The Butthole Surfers making watered-down rock records. Those elements like post-punk and no wave, I was definitely pushing us toward stuff like that.

                The album kicks off with him asking "What about the future of what it is?" on "New Energy" and then seemingly answering his own question on album closer "Swan," an unrelenting, eight-minute epic that captures Justin screaming, over and over, "For what I see is the end is the end, and what I think is the end is the end of the end."

                The reason that song is called "Swan"—well, I might be making this up—but I went and saw the Swans play, and not that our song was derived from them, but after it was written, I thought, that has that feeling of when I went and saw the Swans, just that pounding fucking sound. 
                <br> <br>
                And during the recording, I kept going back and adding guitar tracks. Everybody was like, really, another one? And I'd be like, no, really, it's gotta be there. To get the right effect, it has to be overdone.

                The date had been celebrated, during a show with Brainiac at the Grog Shop in Cleveland, with copious amounts of bourbon and an onstage performance by Captain America, a “beefy stripper in stars and stripes spandex shorts and a white denim vest,” as Sara described him. 
                <br> <br>
                He'd been hired by Dirty, Justin, and Vern to do "some grinding thing" on Sara in the middle of Unwound's set, in front of the entire crowd.

                Opening for Fugazi could be kind of brutal. The crowds were often kind of hostile, because it was only five dollars to get in and you were guaranteed to get a reaction from them if you said or did anything.

                Skinheads showed up because they were all gonna stand together and sieg heil until Ian stopped playing and yelled at them.

                Consistently throughout our life as a band, we had the experience of playing to a room of blank faces, but I think Sonic Youth's crowd was more open to seeing this band they'd never heard of. People would stand there barely reacting, and then when we were done people were totally gushing at us.

                It's funny because as much as we looked up to Fugazi, in certain ways we fit into the Sonic Youth thing more almost. Not that level of touring, but just the way they were as people. They were weirdos, like us, I guess.

                It doesn't take long to realize that 1996's Repetition is defined by Vern Rumsey who makes it immediately clear that he owns this album. 
                With their bassist at the forefront, Unwound takes its brand of moody post-hardcore to a tighter and groovier place than ever witnessed prior. 
              </p>
              <p>
                <!-- Holding true to its name,  -->
                Opening tracks "Message Received," "Corpse Pose," and "Unauthorized Autobiography" make it no illusion how refined Trosper and Rumsey's guitar interplay has become since the band's inception.
              </p>
              <p>
                The record also serves as the petri dish for Unwound's noise experimentation, with shrill, shrieking guitars interpliced between the mysterious verses on "Lowest Common Denominator" and driving rythmn of "Fingernails on a Chalkboard".
                The latter song, making expert use of a clave-esque drum beat, sends the listener down an anxious spiral, catalyzed by a seemingly unresolved 5/4 time signature.
              </p>
              <p>
                "Go to Dallas and Take a Left" ends in free jazz pandemonium, foreshadowing the ambition running through Unwound's to-be 1998 LP Challenge For a Civilized Society.
              </p>
              <p>
                "Lady Elect" stands as a solumn tribute to a friend of Justin Trosper who committed suicide before the recording of the album, carrying all the emotional weight of a man crippled by loss.

                While thematically it's a bit of a throwback, a media and culture rant of the sort that fueled <i>The Future of What</i>, "For Your Entertainment" lacks Future's sense of distance. Considering all that had transpired with Unwound professionally over the previous year, a line like "they'll pick your life apart and throw away your art" could easily be read as Justin admonishing himself.

                By <i>Repetition</i>, I'd failed in some relationships and then, right before we recorded the album, my friend committed suicide, so my emotional landscape dropped pretty heavily. I was like, oh, this death thing's really a lot harder to handle than having some romantic doomsday mentality. Like, when reality hits, you really don't want to experience that.

              <blockquote>
                That the song is concerned with death is easy to discern from the lyrics, but it's the production and Justin's performance that lend the song its emotional weight. The register he sings in is lower than his customary range, giving his voice a tentative, vulnerable quality rather than the aggressively disaffected tone he typically adopted. The vocals on the chorus are doubled, preserving the sense of rawness while also adding heft. Vibraphone delicately ushers in each chord change of the outro. The melodic wail of feedback that ends the track gently soars up an octave and then slowly evaporates.

                When he screamed, it meant something. It was coming from a real place. That should've been the record that made something happen, and instead it was kinda lost.

                I've always felt frustrated, like mad at the world, for under-appreciating Unwound. I always felt their ceiling should have been a hundred times what they maxed out at. I thought they should have been playing Lollapalooza and festivals, and selling 100,000 records, 250,000 records, and flirting with the radio. And I've always wondered, what the fuck, where did it go wrong? 
                <br> <br>
                Maybe Kill Rock Stars just never got enough clout. Maybe we were never a big-enough label. They should've busted out after <i>Repetition</i>, and that's when their trajectory didn't go where I expected. And to this day I don't know why, because I feel like they did everything right.

                You can't sell what we were offering to a mass crowd. We didn't play music you could dance to; we played music that would affect everyone differently, every song, as opposed to keeping one feeling going all the way through one show. I hate the term "emo" but I think the crowd that we played to felt connected, and felt everything that we played in the way that we felt it, in their own terms.

                "Vern and I had this conversation when we were getting involved with BMG about having a plan in case things got weird," Justin recalled. “It was a drunken conspiracy that I don't think Sara was privy to. We called it our five-year plan or something, and we decided that we would just break up the band in five years no matter what."

                Albeit unintentionally, that's exactly what Unwound did. But not before recording their masterpiece.

                There's something especially satisfying about late-blooming bands who spend their whole career building up to their best music, and then calling it a day. That's basically Unwound's arc in a nutshell; the Olympia trio spent a decade gradually tweaking and refining their post-hardcore until they achieved genuine transcendence on their monumental swan song, 2001's Leaves Turn Inside You. They went out on a glorious high that few bands will ever match.

                That dreary ambiance bleeds into Leaves Turn Inside You, which is huge and haunted like nothing else in their discography, conjuring the crescendo-ing sweep of post-rock and the ominous scent of late-autumn rot.
